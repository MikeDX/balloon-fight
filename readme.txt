=======================================

Made for the 2003 remakes competition at www.remakes.org.  A remake of the 1984 Nintendo game, Balloon Fight.  In it, you play a man with balloons on his back, and have to pop other little people's balloons.  That's all there is to it.

-Includes all the single player levels from the original.  After all levels have been completed, they replay randomly.  As in the original, there is no end to this game. 

-The original graphics, and lots of the original beepy little songs mixed with newer sound effects from the DIV archive.

Missing Features

-2 player game not included.  

-'Balloon Trip' game mode also not included.  Here, the player flys through an endless starfield, popping as many balloons as possible.  It's nowhere as fun as the main game, but I still wouldve liked to include it.
